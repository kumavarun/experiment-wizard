**Experiment Wizard** is an open source tool that facilitates the preparation and execution of neuroscientific experiments. It is specially designed to work with the [Emotive EPOC EEG headset](http://emotiv.com/) and [Mirametrix eye trackers](http://mirametrix.com/), but can also be used in off-line mode in order to use only the methods for stimulus presentation and user feedback (keystroke) recording.

You can select image, video and audio stimuli, define their attributes and determine exactly how they should be presented to subjects.

EEG data and keyboard responses are exported for analysis in the form of waveband scores per stimulus, for each of the EPOC's 14 sensors. Both CSV and [ARFF](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) formats are supported. Eye tracker data are stored separately as time stamps plus screen coordinates.

**Note** that a Research Edition of the Emotiv EPOC is required to use the EEG recording features.
